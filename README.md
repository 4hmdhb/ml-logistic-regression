# CS 189 Machine Learning - Homework 4

This repository contains the code and documentation for Homework 4 of the CS 189 Introduction to Machine Learning course at UC Berkeley, Spring 2024. The assignment includes various tasks related to logistic regression, Bayesian interpretation, and regularization techniques.



## Description

Homework 4 consists of coding assignments and math problems covering various machine learning concepts:

1. **Logistic Regression with Newton’s Method**:
   - Derive and implement logistic regression using Newton's Method.
   
2. **Wine Classification with Logistic Regression**:
   - Implement logistic regression for classifying wines as white or red using the given dataset. Includes batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent implementations.
   
3. **A Bayesian Interpretation of Lasso**:
   - Derive the MAP estimation for a given density function and show its equivalence to Lasso regularization.
   
4. **ℓ1-regularization, ℓ2-regularization, and Sparsity**:
   - Analyze and compare the sparsity-inducing properties of ℓ1 and ℓ2 regularization.

## Instructions
